# Comment Creator using ChatGPT

This repository contains a Github action that generates explanations of changes using the OpenAI API as a comment in pull request. It analyzes the differences between two commits in a pull request and provides a summary of the changes.

# Notable Features
- A `token limit` for both `prompt` and `response` can be set to control costs. In the event that the token limit is reached a comment will not be created. The default limit is `10000` prompt tokens and `512` response tokens. For PRs with lots of changes, this limit will most likely need to be increased.
- Prompts can be segmented into `multipe requests` to OpenAIApi and collated into a single response by setting the input `segment-size`, defaults to 3096.
- The comment will be generated based on the `Pull Request Title` and a comparison of the file changes between the `Head SHA` of the pull request branch and the `Base SHA` (I.E Main branch).
- A `custom prompt` can be configured allowing for flexibiliy in the response from ChatGPT. This can be configured via the input `custom-prompt`. The default value is `Combining each part. Summarize the changes in 300 words or less based on the pull request title and file changes.`.
- Specific files and paths can be ignored when generating the changes by configuring the input `ignore-paths`.
- The model used can be configured by setting the input `model`. The default model is `gpt-3.5-turbo`

## Prerequisites

Before running this, ensure you have the following:

- An OpenAI API key.
- A GitHub personal access token.


## Usage

```yml
      - name: ChatGpt Comment
        uses: ps-aartread-org/chatgpt-comment-pull-request@main
```

This action will retrieve the pull request information and generate an explanation of the changes using the OpenAI API. If the explanation exceeds the maximum token limit or there are no changes after filtering, a comment will not be created.

## Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `custom-prompt` | The prompt to feed to ChatGPT | Combining each part. Summarize the changes in 300 words or less based on the pull request title and file changes. | false |
| `frequency-penalty` | Reduces the probability of words that have already been generated | `0` | false |
| `github-token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | true |
| `ignore-paths` | Comma separated list of paths and files those needs to be ignored from explanation | `All files are scanned if nothing is provided` | false |
| `max-prompt-tokens` | The max-prompt-tokens variable is used to limit the number of tokens that are sent to OpenAI when generating an explanation of the changes in a pull request. The default value of 10000 is used. | `10000` | false |
| `max-response-tokens` | The number of tokens allowed in the response | `512` | false |
| `model` | The model to use for the AI | `gpt-3.5-turbo` | false |
| `open-api-key` | OPENAI API Token created from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. | `CHATGPT_API_KEY` | true |
| `response-penalty` | Reduces the probability of a word if it already appeared in the predicted text |     `0` | false |
| `segment-size` | The number of tokens used to segment the prompt | `3096` | false |
| `temperature` | Parameter that controls how much randomness is in the input | `1` | false |
| `top_p` | Controls how many of the highest-probability words are selected to be included in the generated text | `1` | false |

## Configuration

Action provides several configuration options that you can modify based on your requirements:

- `apiKey`: Your OpenAI API key.
- `github-token`: Your GitHub personal access token.
- `max-prompt-tokens`: The maximum number of tokens allowed in the prompt.
- `ignore-paths`: Comma-separated list of file paths or patterns to ignore.
- `model`: The OpenAI language model to use for generating explanations.
- `temerature`: Parameter that controls how much randomness is in the output.
- `max-response-tokens`: The maximum number of tokens allowed in the response.
- `top_p`: Controls how many of the highest-probability words are selected to be included in the generated text.
- `frequency-penalty`: Reduces the probability of words that have already been generated.
- `presence-penalty`: Reduces the probability of a word if it already appeared in the predicted text.
- `segment-size`: The number of tokens used to segment the prompt.

## Action.yml

The `action.yml` file contains the metadata for the action.

runs:
  using: 'node16'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
```

## Index.js

The `index.js` file contains the main logic for the action.

```javascript
// Import required packages and libraries
const axios = require('axios');
const core = require('@actions/core');
const github = require('@actions/github');
const { encode, decode } = require('gpt-3-encoder')

const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const { Octokit } = require('@octokit/rest');
const { context: githubContext } = require('@actions/github');

// ... (rest of the code)
```

## Reference example

The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.
Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

See below for the use cases.

```yml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  chatgptComment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Add Comment
    steps:
      - name: Add Comment
        uses: ps-aartread-org/chatgpt-comment-pull-request@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          open-api-key: ${{ secrets.CHATGPT_API_KEY }}
          max-prompt-tokens: '10000'
          ignore-paths: '.github/*, src/, package*.json, .env*'
          model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
          temperature: 1
          max-response-tokens: 512
          top_p: 1
          frequency-penalty: 0
          presence-penalty: 1

```
